# MVP Specification

## Product Definition

**HysCode** is a desktop-native agentic IDE where AI agents write, edit, and execute code using real developer tools. Built on Tauri v2, it provides a full code editor, integrated terminal, and an AI agent panel that can autonomously perform development tasks using the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology.

### Target Users
- Solo developers building projects with AI assistance
- AI-native development teams wanting deeper tool integration than chat-based copilots
- Developers who want a local-first, privacy-respecting AI coding environment

### Core Value Proposition
> "An IDE where the AI agent is a first-class citizen — not a sidebar chatbot, but an active participant with real tools."

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| App launch to usable editor | < 3 seconds |
| File open time (P75) | < 200ms |
| Agent first-token latency | < 1.5 seconds (after API round-trip) |
| Agent tool execution (P75) | < 500ms per tool call |
| Bundle size (installed) | < 30MB |
| Memory usage (idle) | < 200MB |
| Crash rate | < 1% of sessions |
| SDD spec-to-execution | Full feature in < 10 minutes (simple CRUD) |

## Technical Constraints

1. **Offline-capable**: editor and terminal work without internet; only AI features need connectivity (except Ollama)
2. **Local-first**: all data stored locally in SQLite; no cloud dependencies
3. **Cross-platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux (Tauri v2 targets all three)
4. **Secure by default**: API keys in OS keychain, CSP enforced, sandboxed execution
